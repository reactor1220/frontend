## üéØ Task: Workout Renderer Component

Using the JSON file below as input, build a **React + TailwindCSS component** that displays the workout in the **clearest, most user-friendly way**.

The JSON represents a simple running session with three segments:

**Warmup**  
5min at Z1, followed by 5min fartlek

**Main set**  
8 sets of 1min at high intensity followed by 30 sec rest before the next set

**Cool down**  
5min easy jog to recover

Your goal is to take this structure and display it in a clean and understandable format for users.

**What we're evaluating:**

- Your ability to interpret structured workout data
- Visual clarity and layout
- Reusable component structure
- How well the final result communicates the training intent

**Use this JSON as your input:**
